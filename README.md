# dockerepo
This is my test repository which is linked to my docker hub and build is triggered there once any changes in code repository. The Docker Hub will then pull down your repository and build your Dockerfile to create a Docker repository and push it onto the Docker Hub
so that it is available for others to download. When you commit changes to your git Repo the Docker Hub will keep the Docker Repository up to date.
